# CData.jl: (C-Data) Analysis/Visualization Suite

"Focus on the analysis itself, not data manipulation"

## Description

CData.jl (C-Data) provides a collection of tools to simplify the analysis of large multi-dimensional datasets & better visualize (*see*) mathematical relationships buried within.

In other words, the goal is to provide analysis tools that lead to minimal code, written in a *natural*, and *readable* fashion.  In particular, the tools will help perform the following operations:

 1. Read in complex multi-dimensional input data.
 1. Perform the same operation on all elements (usually) without having to write explicit loops.
 1. Quickly organize and plot the results in a way that sheds light on the studied phenomenon.
 1. Save data and plot configuration to a single .hdf5 file.
 1. Reload plot data for further investigation at a later time.
 1. Render plots using different plotting backends (possibly at a later date).

The C-Data toolkit was initially designed to assist with circuit-data (C-Data) analysis.  That being said, C-Data provides a generic toolkit that can also be applied to other scientific fields.

The C-Data toolkit is implemented in the Julia Programming Language.

### Supported Plotting Backends

NOTE: The term "load time" is used loosely below to indicate time to first plot.

 - **InspectDR.jl**: One of the fastest solutions with the shortest load times.  InspectDR also provides basic interactivity, but is relatively new/untested, and has fewer features than other backends (ex: Matplotlib).
 - **Grace/xmgrace**: Short load times and fast when dealing with small datasets.  The GUI feels a bit dated and unfamiliar, but one can readily fine tune almost any visual element to generate publication-quality plots.
 - **Matplotlib/PyPlot.jl**: Longer load times (loading anaconda).  Faster than Grace/xmgrace solution when dealing with moderately-sized datasets (~200k points).
 - **Qwt/guiqwt**: Longer load times (loading anaconda).  Faster than Matplotlib/PyPlot.jl solution when dealing with moderately-sized datasets (~200k points).
  - guiqwt appears slow when plotting a large *number of traces* (ex: eye diagram of a long transient dataset split into many individual traces).
 - **Plots.jl/(\*.jl)**: Uniform plotting interface supporting multiple backends.  In particular, there are signs that GR.jl will potentially be one of the fastest.
  - The GR.jl backend is not yet mature: Does not support subplots, cannot display multiple plot windows, ...

## Installation

 1. [Install Julia](https://github.com/ma-laforge/HowTo/tree/master/julia/julia_install.md#Installation)

  - Might also need to install `curl` (Not currently a proper dependency of Julia, but needed by certain packages).

			sudo apt-get install curl

  - If `curl` still causes issues, it might be necessary to add a `~/.curlrc` file with the following (Ubuntu):

			cacert=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

 1. Optional: [Install Anaconda distribution of Python 2.7](https://github.com/ma-laforge/HowTo/tree/master/conda/conda_install.md#Py27Installation)

  - Anaconda is required if one is to render plots with Matplotlib/PyPlot.jl or Qwt/guiqwt.

 1. Install C-Data Julia modules (Prompts to install python/PyCall-based modules).

		julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/ma-laforge/CData.jl.git")
		julia> using CData
		julia> CData.install()

 1. Optional backend: [Install Grace](https://github.com/ma-laforge/HowTo/tree/master/grace/grace_install.md#Installation)

  - The installation of Grace is probably the simplest amongst of all backends.
  - That being said, issues were found where GracePlot/Grace interactions cause certain Ubuntu installations to logout the user.  After further reading, the author believes this might have something to do with the X-server.  The issue could only be circumvented by running C-Data from a VMWare session running yet another Ubuntu installation.

 1. Optional backend: [Install PyPlot](https://github.com/ma-laforge/HowTo/tree/master/julia/julia_install.md#PyPlot)

 1. Optional backend: [Install guiqwt](https://github.com/ma-laforge/HowTo/tree/master/guiqwt/guiqwt_install.md#Py27Installation)

## Sample Usage

Examples demonstrating the capabilities of the C-Data toolkit can be found under the [SignalProcessing.jl](https://github.com/ma-laforge/SignalProcessing.jl) module [sample/ subdirectory](https://github.com/ma-laforge/SignalProcessing.jl/tree/master/sample).

### Sample Output Gallery

Outputs of said examples, as generated with the EasyPlotGrace.jl module, can be viewed in the [SignalProcessing Gallery](https://github.com/ma-laforge/FileRepo/tree/master/SignalProcessing/sampleplots).

### Generating Sample Output

The plots associated with this sample subdirectory can be generated by running sample/runtests.jl of the SignalProcessing.jl module:

		$ cd [JULIA_PKGDIR]/SignalProcessing
		$ julia
		julia> include("test/runtests.jl")

where `JULIA_PKGDIR` is easily located from the Julia console:

		$ julia
		julia> Pkg.dir()

By default, runtests.jl will render plots using the PyPlot/Matplotlib backend.  To change the default backend, set the `EASYPLOT_DEFAULTDISPLAY` environment variable, as described in [EasyPlot.jl](https://github.com/ma-laforge/EasyPlot.jl).

## Known Limitations

The C-Data module is always tracking master branches, making it a relatively unstable platform for development.  This is particularly true when changes are made to the programming interface.

Although `NumericIO` and `InspectDR` are registered modules (can be added with `Pkg.add(...)`), the `CData` installation pulls them in using `Pkg.clone(...)`.  In theory, this ensures no modules are left with an incompatible version.

### Compatibility

Extensive compatibility testing of the C-Data toolkit has not been performed.  The module has been tested using the following environment(s):

 - Linux / Julia-0.4.2 (64-bit) / Anaconda 2.1.0 (64-bit w/Python 2.7.11)

## Disclaimer

The C-Data toolkit is not yet mature.  Expect significant changes.

This software is provided "as is", with no guarantee of correctness.  Use at own risk.
